Your boss has given you the following project to fix for a client. It's supposed to be a simple dice
game where the object of the game is to correctly add up the values of the dice for 6 consecutive turns.

The issue is that a former programmer worked on it and didn't know how to debug effectively. It's now up to
you to fix the errors and finally make the game playable.

To play the game you must run the main.py file.
